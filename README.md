# Gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory (gPCT)

An original theory proposing that gravitational phase slope modulates the polarity of quantum collapse. This repo contains all replication tools, data, and documents.

## Addendum: The White Equation

An addendum to the gPCT paper introduces the **White Equation**, a recursive derivative expression that not only models collapse symmetry resolution but *fails at the exact timing threshold where collapse does*. The equation converges to 1/2π and defines a natural collapse rate limit (~10 Hz).
