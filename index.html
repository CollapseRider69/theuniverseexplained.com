    <h2>What Is gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory?</h2>
    <p>
      gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory (gPCT) proposes that quantum collapse symmetry is locally modulated by gravitational phase — particularly the rate of change in gravitational influence (dG/dt), as expressed through natural phenomena like tides and lunar position. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory is supported by statistically significant data showing flow bias inversion at lunar altitude zero-crossings. These polarity flips are consistent, symmetric, and cancel out globally, preserving quantum randomness while revealing hidden structure at the local level. 
    </p>
    <p>
      gPCT offers a bridge between quantum mechanics and relativity without invoking exotic mechanisms, suggesting that gravitational rhythm — not amplitude — may subtly modulate when and how quantum outcomes collapse into classical reality.
