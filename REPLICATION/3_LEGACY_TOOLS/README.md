# Replication Tools for FlowShamBo and gPCT Testing

This folder contains all scripts, instructions, and tools required to replicate the experiments and analysis described in the Gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory (gPCT) project.

## Contents

### Experiment Code
- `FlowShamBo_ENTROPY_TEST.py`  
  Main testbed. A time-seeded, entropy game-of-chance.

### Gravitational & Lunar Tools
- `moon_altitude.py`  
  Generates moon altitude data for your location and test window.

- `dTide_dt.py`  
  Converts harmonic tide data into a dTide/dt CSV file for analysis.

- `lunar_lag_shift_tool.py`  
  Applies daily lunar lag correction and outputs lag-adjusted tide.csv.

- `lunar_phase_sweep_alignment.py`
  Aligns to lunar-midnight for phase sweep analysis.
  
### Analysis & Visualization
- `gpct_analysis.py`  
  Computes r, p, and z correlation statistics from FlowShamBo and gravitational phase data.

- `gpct_graph_analysis.py`  
  Visualizes correlations between z-scored FlowMeter and moon altitude/dTide_dt.

- `phase_sweep_analysis.py`  
  Sweeps dTide/dt across 1-hour phase windows to detect optimal alignment.

### Documentation
- `gpct_replication_instructions.txt`  
  Full step-by-step guide for setting up the environment, running the test, and analyzing the results.

- `LICENSE`  
  MIT License for all scripts and analysis code.
