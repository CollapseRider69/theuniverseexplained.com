# Replication Tools for FlowShamBo and gPCT Testing

This folder contains all scripts, instructions, and tools required to replicate the experiments and analysis described in the Gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory (gPCT) project.

## Contents

### Experiment Code
- `FlowShamBo_REALTIME_RUNNER_V2.py`  
  Main testbed. A perceptual-architecture entropy system designed to detect gravitational modulation of collapse symmetry.
  
- `FlowShamBo_dual_launcher.py`  
  Launches FlowShamBo in real-time alongside its external logger.

- `FlowShamBo_external_realtime_logger.py`  
  Logs FlowShamBo outcomes with real-time timestamps for later correlation.

- `coinflip_entropy_test.py`  
  A control experiment using a time-seeded coin flip to compare against the FlowShamBo architecture.

### Gravitational & Lunar Tools
- `moon_altitude.py`  
  Generates moon altitude data for your location and test window.

- `dTide_dt.py`  
  Converts harmonic tide data into a dTide/dt CSV file for analysis.

- `lunar_lag_shift_tool.py`  
  Applies daily lunar lag correction and outputs lag-adjusted tide.csv.

### Analysis & Visualization
- `gpct_analysis_FINAL.py`  
  Computes r, p, and z correlation statistics from FlowShamBo and gravitational phase data.

- `gpct_graph_analysis.py`  
  Visualizes correlations between z-scored FlowMeter and moon altitude/dTide_dt.

- `phase_sweep_analysis.py`  
  Sweeps dTide/dt across 1-hour phase windows to detect optimal alignment.

### Documentation
- `gpct_replication_instructions.txt`  
  Full step-by-step guide for setting up the environment, running the test, and analyzing the results.

- `LICENSE`  
  MIT License for all scripts and analysis code.
