## Core Insight

Gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory (gPCT) proposes that *gravitational phase slope* (the rate of change of gravitational amplitude, dG/dt) modulates the polarity of quantum collapse. While quantum randomness remains globally neutral, local outcomes can exhibit statistically significant polarity lean aligned with gravitational slope — flipping at phase inflection points like lunar horizon crossings.

This explains how local quantum resolution (collapse) can show phase-locked bias while preserving global statistical symmetry through periodic gravitational reversals (e.g., tides, orbits).

## Key Concepts

- **Collapse is continuous** and gravitationally modulated, not triggered solely by observation.
- **Gravitational phase (ϕg)** is a temporal polarity derived from local gravitational slope (dG/dt), not static amplitude.
- **When dG/dt = 0**, collapse polarity flips. This is observed as phase inversions at lunar 0º altitude.
- **Quantum systems are blind to direction**, but sensitive to ϕg. Classical systems are the reverse.

## Empirical Evidence

- Repeated experiments ("FlowShamBo") show strong inverse correlation between gravitational slope and entropy resolution polarity.
- Collapse bias flips predictably at lunar zero-crossings (Moon crossing the local horizon), revealing a consistent dG/dt-dependent collapse modulation effect.
- Entropy from cryptographic systems (e.g., solo Bitcoin mining with Bitaxe) shows similar inversion structure, suggesting external entropy is also slope-sensitive.

## Implication for Black Holes

gPCT offers a new framing of the black hole information paradox: information is not lost, because it **never occurs**. Inside the event horizon, gravitational slope is undefined or fully inward-collapsing. Collapse symmetry cannot break. Decoherence halts. Classical information is never written.
