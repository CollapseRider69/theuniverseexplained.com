## Core Insight

Gravitational Phase-Cancellation Theory (gPCT) proposes that *gravitational phase slope* — the rate of change of gravitational amplitude ($dG/dt$) — modulates the polarity of quantum collapse. While global outcomes remain statistically neutral, local outcomes exhibit polarity lean based on whether the dominant gravitational source is approaching or receding in the observer’s frame.

Collapse polarity flips at slope zero-crossings, and leans with gravitational rhythm. Over time, this structure resolves into global symmetry through natural phase cancellation.

## Key Concepts

- **Collapse is continuous** — modulated by gravitational slope, not triggered by observation.
- **Gravitational phase ($\phi_g$)** is a time-domain polarity derived from $dG/dt$, not static amplitude.
- **When $dG/dt = 0$**, collapse polarity flips — not at altitude landmarks, but at slope reversals.
- **Quantum systems are blind to direction** but sensitive to $\phi_g$. Classical systems are the reverse.

## Empirical Evidence

- 10-million-round FlowShamBo experiment over 12 days showed a clean sinusoidal Z-flip across gravitational phase offsets.
- Segmenting by gravitational slope (ascent vs descent) yielded mirrored correlation and massive Z-flip cancellation — with total $r \approx 0$.
- A timestamp-aligned phase sweep confirmed that collapse modulation follows gravitational slope, not altitude.
- Behavior is consistent with continuous, reversible modulation rather than discrete collapse events.

## Implication for Black Holes

gPCT reframes the black hole information paradox:  
> Information is not lost — it never happens.

Inside an event horizon, gravitational slope collapses inward or becomes undefined. Collapse symmetry cannot break. Decoherence halts. Classical outcomes are never written.
